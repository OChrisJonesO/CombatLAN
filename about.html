        <p>CombatLAN is a PC gaming-focused community in the southeast Ohio region. We regularly play games together on our self hosted community servers, and host multiple LAN parties throughout the year. Anyone is welcome to join the official
            Discord chat, community forums, or to join us in game. Additionally, we welcome all to participate in our LAN party events. </p>
        <p>What goes on at a CombatLAN LAN party event? I'm glad you asked! Essentially, we rent out a space for the weekend and fill it up with folding 6-foot tables. CombatLAN is a BYOC (bring your own computer) event, so up to 48 people
            will show up with their gaming rigs/consoles, set up at their reserved seats, and link up with the internal network. From there, we have a private text/voice chat via Discord for smack talk, and a plethora of LAN servers to
            play on. The entire event is free-play, meaning there are no limitations on what games you can/can't play. Singleplayer, co-op, splitscreen, LAN multiplayer, online multiplayer, doesn't matter!</p>
        <p>In addition to the 24/7 free-play, we also have a few tournaments to run for popular games. FPS, MOBA, car soccer(?), old school, and more! Our tournaments are all sponsored by one of our wonderful sponsors, and the winning individuals/teams
            will be taking home the grand prize, which differs on a per-tournament basis (see the tournaments <a href="tournaments.html">here</a>).</p>
        <p>On top of tournaments having prizes given to the winners, we also have <a href="prizes.html">quite the loot</a> to giveaway in our general admission raffle! In order to be eligible for the raffle, all you have to do is A) purchase
            a ticket to attend (duh!) and B) be present at the time of the raffle if your name is called. Sounds easy, right? Well, that's because it is! On top of all of this, we have a number of other <a href="attractions.html">attractions</a>                            you may be interested in (VR &amp; 3D printing booths anyone?)</p>
        <p>Our LANs consit of a local gigabit (1000Mbps) up, gigabit down link with up to 48 slots to ensure low pings and reliable connections. We also provide a 50Mbps down, 5Mbps up connection to the internet, with complimentary Wi-Fi.
            All network activity is tracked and optimized via our custom pfSense router/firewall to ensure quality LAN traffic.</p>
        <p>Overall, our LAN parties are a blast. 48 hours dedicated to non-stop PC gaming with friends, foes, and other local gamers. Come to socialize, game, win some loot, eat an unhealthy amount of pizza, and have a great time.</p>
        <p>And they wouldn't be possible without the hard work of the CombatLAN admins. These are the volunteers you'll see at the event wearing staff t-shirts. They help organize the event, work with sponsors/partners, setup the network,
            ban cheaters, and make sure everything goes smoothly. </p>
        <p>What does the future of CombatLAN look like? Well, we are always looking to grow! We currently have a network limitation of 48 slots (plus a few open slots for CombatLAN admins) but plan to expand our network to grow with the event.
            Once we have a larger venue and higher attendance interest, we will invest in more switches to allow for more people!</p>

                    <li>CombatLAN operates on a simple 3-strikes, you're out policy. Break any of these rules a total of 3 times and you will be asked to leave the LAN and not to return. </li>
                    <li>Cheating is not allowed in tournaments, or in any circumstances where it puts you at an advantage and ruins the fun for everyone else. </li>
                    <li>No illegal activity of any kind will be tolerated. Anyone caught with illegal drugs or substances, or anyone caught stealing will be immediately escorted from the event, and local police will be contacted.</li>
                    <li>Respect the CombatLAN Admins and all other CombatLAN attendees. While trash talk is to be expected at a LAN party, any racist, homophobic, sexist, or otherwise derogatory/offensive remarks are not accepted. Please keep it cool
                        and respect your fellow gamers.</li>
                    <li>Headphones/headsets only please - no speakers allowed. We will have background music playing on the speakers at the venue, but if we allowed everyone to bring speakers to the event it would be incredibly loud and distracting.</li>
                    <li>Please check your network sharing settings on the PC you bring to the LAN to ensure you are not sharing anything you don't want everyone else to have access to. Make sure your system is virus free and secure ahead of time.</li>
                    <li>Internet bandwidth is limited, and shared amongst every attendee. Please limit your network activity to a minimum - this means no torrenting! We will have a local file share setup if you need to download game files / updates or
                        other common programs.</li>
                    <li>You are 100% responsible for any damage you cause to the venue.</li>
                    <li>Ultimately, the CombatLAN Admins have the final say and we may have to make a decision you don't like.</li>
                    <li>Have FUN!</li>

Essentially, a bunch of people bring their gaming computers/consoles to one location, join a local network, and play with or against each other in multiplayer games! Having everyone connect to a local network as opposed to the internet ensures that everyone will have great pings and solid connections. Additionally, you can run custom game servers to enable mods and other unique gameplay experiences. Overall it's a weekend full of video games, friends, and pizza!</span></div>

There are a total of 4 raffle sessions, one at the beginning and end of each day.

We'll even let you keep it afterwards. Don't know how to do all that? Just bring one with you. </span></div>

Please check your network shares on the PC you plan to bring to the LAN to ensure that you don't have anything publicly available that you don't want others to see.

Just wanted to make a very brief post teasing what is to come. CombatLAN is (finally) going to be receiving a proper website overhaul. As a web developer myself, this was a long time coming and something that should have been done a while ago. I apologize for the delay, but thankfully I've had some spare time to work on this recently.

Just as a teaser, the new site will have a complete re-design (making it nice to look at for once), be responsive ready, have its own dedicated forums, direct access to the main FTP, and much much more! The new site will also have its own ticket purchasing / seat reservation system, which should significantly streamline the process of ordering tickets. Stay tuned to our social media for more updates, and check back in the coming weeks to see the official launch of the new site!

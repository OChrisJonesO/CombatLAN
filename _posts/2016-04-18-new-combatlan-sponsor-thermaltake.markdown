page-name: New CombatLAN Sponsor - Thermaltake
---
CombatLAN is proud to announce yet another sponsorship! After running my main rig in their <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA9FT3GT2389" target="_blank">Suppressor F51</a> case (which is one of the best deals on a silent case, period) for over 6 months now, I can personally vouch for these guys and their products.

<a href="http://www.thermaltakeusa.com/" target="_blank">Thermaltake</a>is the latest company to hop onto the CombatLAN sponsorship bandwagon, just in time for CombatLAN v4.0! Thermaltake has generously reached out to us and donated a few prizes for us to raffle off that we will be announcing very shortly.

Show them some love on their social media links below.

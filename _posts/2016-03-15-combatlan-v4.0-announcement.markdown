Introducing CombatLAN v4.0 - the biggest LAN we've had so far! CombatLAN v4.0 has more sponsors, more bandwith, and more seats available than ever before! Our 48 person LAN (not including CombatLAN Admins) will have a full gigabit backbone and 8 corporate sponsors!

Tickets are on sale now at the <a href="/tickets.html">tickets section</a> for $25USD + local tax. We have an <a href="http://combatlan.com/forums/d/5-official-combatlan-v4-0-thread" target="_blank">official v4.0 thread</a> going on in the forums where you can discuss the LAN leading up to the event. Otherwise, check out the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ section</a> to find out more info on the event, and we look forward to seeing you there!

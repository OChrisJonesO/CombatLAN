As some of you who frequent the Discord have probably noticed, the past week or so connections have relatively unstable at best, with frequent dropping in/out of voice chat and failed delivery of text chat messages.

<a href="http://www.discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> themselves have acknowledged these issues recently and have publicly responded, promising server upgrades in the near future to resolve these issues. Please keep in mind that unlike Teamspeak, Discord servers are not self hostable and run entirely on their end. While this makes it <em>a million times easier</em> to manage, it also puts you and your community at the mercy of their network 24/7/365, including those unfortunate times when they are being hit by DDOS attacks.

If there was anything I could do personally to fix these issues and ensure better connections, I would. However, this is out of my control. As stated, these issues should be resolved soon though, so be sure to stay tuned.

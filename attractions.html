<h1>LAN Gaming</h1>
<p>Play your favorite games with the lowest pings possible. Chat with other local gamers, compete in tournaments, and win awesome prizes in our raffle! </p>
<hr>
<h1>Free Drinks / Snacks </h1>
<p>All attendees of CombatLAN will have access to complimentary energy drinks, sodas, and water in addition to snacks to keep fueling your gaming sessions. Drinks usually include at least RedBull, Monster Energy, and Mountain dew, and are  generously donated by our sponsors. Alcoholic beverages can also be purchased for those of you who are 21+.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Buy, Sell, &amp; Trade</h1>
<p>You know that closet full of computer/networking gear that we all have lying around? Bring it in to CombatLAN to buy, sell, and trade with other attendees at the for sale tables! Just bought a new GPU? Why not sell the old one to a gamer in need? Have an extra case from that build that you never quite finished? Trade it in for that sweet RGB backlit mechanical keyboard you've always wanted.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Trading Card &amp; Board Games</h1>
<p>We will have multiple folding card tables setup and open for TCG &amp; Board games. These tables are separate from the main BYOC tables to keep away from all the cords &amp; clutter. Whether you want to play a game of poker, Cards against Humanity, Magic the Gathering, or Settlers of Catan, we'll have plenty of space for you and your friends to gather around.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Console &amp; "Party" Games</h1>
<p>CombatLAN will also have a section setup and dedicated to popular multiplayer party games - think Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution, Mario Party, Wii Sports, those sort of games. These systems will be setup and available for all attendees on a first-come, first serve basis.</p>
<hr>
<h1>3D Printing Booth</h1>
<p>CombatLAN V4.0 will have multiple 3D Printers setup and running, to educate and inform attendees about the world of 3D printing, and also to 3D print whatever you want! Maybe you want a custom Cherry MX keycap, a keychain with your clan name, or an action figure of your favorite video game character! At CombatLAN v4.0, you can learn the basics of 3D modeling and print preparation, and of course see your print come to life! </p>
<p>Prints are done on a pay-per-print basis. To allow everyone an opportunity to 3D print something, please limit the size of your print to 5x5x5 to cut down on print time. </p>
<hr>
<h1>Virtual Reality Booth</h1>
<p>VR technology has just hit the market, and in case you haven't yet invested in turning your bedroom/office into the holodeck, we'd like to give you the opportunity to try before you buy. CombatLAN v4.0 will have a virtual reality booth setup with Oculus Rift and Virtuix Omni, to give VR demos. This booth is powered by a top-of-the-line gaming PC, and is open to all attendees.</p>
<p>Pilot a futuristic spacecraft, parkour atop city rooftops, literally experience D-Day of WWII, or race the fastest sports cars on the planet - all in VR. </p>
<hr>
<h1>Open Source Game Development</h1>
<p>Want to learn a bit about how you favorite games are created? We will also be hosting an open-source game development project for the game <em>Battle of the Bugs</em> - a multiplayer RTS for PC in which players control colonies of military insects and battle it out to conquer the landscape. This is a free, open-source project that anyone is able to contribute to. Get an introduction to Unity Game Development ahead of time and contribute your code, music, or art to this project. Work with the developers first hand at CombatLAN v4.0!</p>

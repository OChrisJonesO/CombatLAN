page-name: Official Minecraft Server Now Live
---
After quite a large community demand, we now have an official Minecraft server up and running! Once again, this one is locally hosted and completely under our control. We will be running vanilla Minecraft for the immediate future, and the server will allow you to seamlessly transition between both Creative and Survival modes. We plan on adding a number of Minecraft mods to this server in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

All of the usual CombatLAN Admins have already been "/op"ed and have full server commands at their disposal. Server details can be found below.

We'll see you in game!
